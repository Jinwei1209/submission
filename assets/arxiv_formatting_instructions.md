# Accepted Papers Formatting Instructions

These are the final formatting and submission isntructions for MELBA **Accepted** papers.

At every step below where we ask for communication or delivery of a file, please use the scholastica [Discussions](https://help.scholasticahq.com/article/117-how-do-discussions-work) mechanism.

1. Switch the template option to ‘final’ option in the first lines of the latex: `\usepackage[final]{melba} `
2. Please populate the `\melbaheading` command options as instructed in the latex comments with the article information provided in the final acceptance email.  
3. Complete the **Ethical Standards** and **Conflicts of Interest** sections at the end of the paper.   
4. Upload your final pdf version via the [Discussions](https://help.scholasticahq.com/article/117-how-do-discussions-work) page.
5. When the MELBA Associate Editor accepts the pdf version, upload this final paper version to arXiv *without any further changes*. Please do **not** upload it before you have received final pdf acceptance. The arXiv Comments field **must** say *“Accepted for publication at the Journal of Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging (MELBA)  https://melba-journal.org”*. If you have already uploaded an earlier preprint to arxiv (e.g. if you chose that route for submission to MELBA), please update that version instead of creating a new arXiv submission.
6. Let us know of the final arXiv preprint ID (e.g. 1809.05231) and version (e.g. v3), and a representative high-resolution image to include in our announcements.
7. Once this is done, **no further updates are permitted** to the arxiv submission, as any update would not have been reviewed by the MELBA journal.

Thank you for submitting to MELBA!
